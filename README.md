## SimpleAFMetro.com (Front End)
This is the front end for [SimpleAFMetro.com](https://www.simpleafmetro.com) - a web app for the DC Metrorail system. SimpleAFMetro is a single page web application that was designed with mobile use in mind. It is a simple and straightforward way to find the closest Metro station and navigate you there, if you so choose. Simplicity and utility were the first priorities when designing this app.

## Features
- Mobile-optimized selectors for starting and ending stations
- Selectable option to sort stations by distance from the user (HTML5 Geolocation)
- Can open the device's native GPS navigation app and route the user to the selected station
- Live arrivals that update and re-render automatically every 30 seconds
- Live alerts and incidents
- Trip information including distance, time, and currently applicable fare

## Motivation for SimpleAFMetro.com
I created this project mainly for two reasons.

First: I wanted to improve my understanding of several specific technologies. I wanted to work on something where I could learn more about making use of a third party API that provides live data. I wanted to use Redux.js to be able to update and render live data to various React.js components. I also wanted to create a project that was designed to be used on mobile devices and use location data.

Second: I wanted to create something that solved a problem. I felt like there wasn't really a simple way to get just the relevant DC Metrorail information I needed and nothing else, so I decided to make it a project of mine.

## Made with:

- [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [React-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux)
- [Redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
- [Material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)

## Development Environment Installation

#### Prerequisites:
- A working installation of Node.js and the ability to run the correct version

#### Fork and clone the repo.

#### Install all packages with npm:
`$ cd <root dir of clone>`  
`$ npm install`

#### Start the local React dev server:
`$ npm start`

#### To run the backend API locally:
- Normally, this single page application will use the remote production API at api.simpleafmetro.com/api/v1/. To use the API locally, set it up according to the instructions in [SimpleAFMetro.com (Back End)](https://github.com/Dusty211/backend-metro-app), and change the URL in src/fetches/hostAddress.js according to where the API is running locally.  You may need to change cors policy in config/initializers/cors.rb.
