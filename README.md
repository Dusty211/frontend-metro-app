## SimpleAFMetro.com (Front End)
This is the front end for [SimpleAFMetro.com](https://www.simpleafmetro.com) - a web app for the DC Metrorail system. SimpleAFMetro is a single page web application that was designed with mobile use in mind. It is a simple and straightforward way to find the closest Metro station and navigate you there if you so choose. Simplicity and utility were the first priorities when designing this app.

## Features
- Mobile-optimized selectors for starting and ending stations
- Selectable option to sort stations by distance from the user (HTML5 Geolocation)
- It can open the device's native GPS navigation app and route the user to the selected station
- Live arrivals that update and re-render automatically every 30 seconds
- Live Alerts and Incidents
- Trip information including distance, time, and currently applicable fare.

## Motivation for SimpleAFMetro.com
I created this project mainly for two reasons.

First: There were several technologies I thought it would be good to learn more about. I wanted to work on something where I could learn more about making use of a third party API that provides live data. I wanted to use Redux.js to be able to update and render live data to various React.js components. I also wanted to create a project that was designed to be used on mobile devices and use location data.

Second: I wanted to create something that solved a problem. I felt like there wasn't really a simple way to get just the relevant DC Metrorail information I needed and nothing else, so I decided to make it a project of mine.
